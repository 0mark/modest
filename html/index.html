<h1>modest - a modest e-mail client</h1>

<h2><img src="emailx_main.png" align="right"> what is it</h2>
<strong>modest</strong> is an e-mail client designed for systems with modest
hardware (by 2006 standards). Main target for this is the <a
href="http://www.nokia.com/770" >Nokia 770 Internet Tablet</a> and the <a
href="http://gpe.handhelds.org" >GPE</a>-environment. But the software will of
course also work on systems with less-modest hardware, such as desktop PCs.

<h2>what does it consist of</h2>
<strong>modest</strong> uses well-known and lesser-known open-source components:
<ul>
  <li><strong>libcamel</strong>: <a
  href="http://go-evolution.org/Camel">libcamel</a> is the e-mail handling
  library originally designed for the <a
  href="http://go-evolution.org/Main_Page" >Evolution</a> e-mail client. It
  supports all the usual (POP3, IMAP, SMTP) protocols, and some unusual as
  well, such as Microsoft Exchange and Novell Groupwise.

  <li><strong>tinymail</strong>: while libcamel is very powerful, it also
  requires quite a bit of memory.  Enter <strong>tinymail</strong>, an
  email-client development framework, written by <em>Philip van Hoof</em>.
  With tinymail, libcamel can be used in a very memory-efficient way.

  <li><strong>GTK+</strong> and/or <strong>Hildon</strong>: for its
  user-interface, <strong>modest</strong> supports multiple
  user-interfaces. Both plain-GTK+ and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGPL" >Hildon</a>-UIs
  - the latter
  for the running on the 770, and the former for use in other environments,
  such as GPE and Linux-desktops.
</ul>

<h2>frequently asked questions</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Q: what does <tt>modest</tt> require?</strong>. <tt>modest</tt>
  in its GTK+ incarnation requires <tt>libcamel</tt>, <tt>tinymail</tt> and
  <tt>gtk+ 2.6 or higher</tt> and <tt>libglade</tt>. For Hildon, also the
  <tt>hildon</tt> libraries are required.

  <li><strong>Q: will it run on Windows?</strong>. Well, <em>maybe</em>. All
  the components should run on Windows, so in theory the program should
  work. We haven't tried that yet, though. Please tell us if you got it running!

  <li><strong>Q: will it run on MacOS?</strong>. Well, <em>maybe</em>. All
  the components should there - and it should be a lot easier than on
  Windows. Again, we haven't tried it. Please tell us if you got it working!
