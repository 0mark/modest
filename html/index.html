<h2>welcome</h2> 
Welcome! <tt><strong>modest</strong></tt> is a small e-mail
program specifically targetting modest hardware, such as low-end PCs and
internet tablets like the <em>Nokia 770</em> and <em>N800</em> internet
tablets. It's <strong>not</strong> meant as a replacement for more
full-featured e-mail programs, such
as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_Outlook"
>MS-Outlook</a>, <a href="http://www.go-evolution.org/Main_Page"
>Evolution</a> or <a href="http://kmail.kde.org/" >KMail</a>.
<p><tt>modest</tt> was born in the first half of 2006 already, but it was
  mostly a little experiment. Lately, we've been putting some more energy and
  resources in the development. And as of the end of February 2007, we are
  opening development for the outside world as well. <strong>Note</strong>
  however, that at this stage it's still <em>very</em> experimental, and we
  are targetting developers and hackers only; that is why we are not providing
  installable packages yet. We hope that will change soon though. We're at the
  stage where have a lot of the lego bricks made, but need to put them
  together. This is not replacement for any existing e-mail client yet.
  Please bear with us.
<p>As you can see from the screenshots, the UI is still a bit rough. Other
things that are not working yet are address book integration, attachments and
backups. But, modest should be usable for some light e-mailing action. No
guarantees however, that it will not send suggestive e-mails to your boss, or
turn your hair gray.
<p><strong>get the code:</strong><tt>svn checkout https://garage.maemo.org/svn/modest/trunk modest</tt>

<h2>frontends</h2>
<img src="modest20070223-gtk.png" border="0" align="right">Currently, there are two frontends for modest: one for general Linux-Desktop usage (<tt>gtk</tt>), and one for the Nokia 770/N800 (<tt>maemo</tt>). The software is structured in such a way that it would be quite easy to add additional frontends, but we're concentrating on these two.
<p>Modest with the <tt>gtk</tt>-frontend runs on desktop-Linux (tested with
  recent Ubuntu, on i386 and AMD64). The <tt>maemo</tt>-frontend runs on N800
  Internet Tablets, and in the corresponding scratchbox environment. (It
  should work on 770 as well, but that will require some work in tinymail).

<h2>dependencies</h2>
<tt>modest</tt> depends on the excellent <a href="http://www.tinymail.org"
					    >tinymail e-mail framework</a>,
written by <a href="http://pvanhoof.be/blog/" >Philip Van Hoof</a>. Tinymail,
in turn, depends on <a href="http://www.go-evolution.org/Camel" >Camel</a>, a
mature e-mail protocol library that is also used by Evolution. Note that the
version of Camel that tinymail uses is not the 'official' version, but instead
a version that is optimized for small memory usage - <tt>camel-lite</tt>. This is shipped
as part of tinymail.

<h2>documentation</h2>
There's quite a bit of developer documentation available:
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="https://garage.maemo.org/projects/modest/">modest garage project page</a>;
  <li>The <strong>modest technical reference</strong> (in svn);
  <li>The <a href="http://tinymail.org/trac/tinymail" >Tinymail reference</a>;
  <li>The <a href="http://www.go-evolution.org/Camel" >Camel Library docs</a>
</ul>
In addition, there's of course the documentation for <a href="http://www.gtk.org/api/" >GTK+/GLib</a> and <a href="http://maemo.org/platform/docs/api-index.html" >Maemo</a>.
