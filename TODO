Non-exhaustive list of Todo items
---------------------------------
(I've you're working on something, please communicate with the others...)


- update ModestTnyHeaderTreeView with sorting, showing/hiding of 
  columns, icons, d&d. Atm, the column code is the gtk/ and gtk-glade/ but
  it should be in ModestTnyHeaderTreeView instead
  interaction with tinymail requires some analysis

- implement ModestTnyHeaderTreeActions, with all the actions for message
  headers - delete / move-to-folder / open / reply (these last will 
  interface iwth ModestMessageActions

- update ModestTnyFolderTreeView with sorting, icons etc. As for
  ModestTnyHeaderTreeView, the UI-code for columns should be moved here.
  require some analysis with what tinymail is doing

- implement ModestTnyFolderTreeActions with all the actions for the folders,
  such as delete / rename

- implement ModestMessageActions with things like open, reply, forward etc.

- implement ModestTransportActions with send, send_later, save (ie. do things
  with mails)

- implement ModestStoreActions with receive / update 

- implement ModestToolbar, which knows about all possible
  email toolbar items, an can be shown/hidden and made
  (in)sensitive.  Easiest would be do have do something like
  modest_toolbar_show_buttons (MODEST_TOOLBAR_BUTTON_REPLY | 
                               MODEST_TOOLBAR_BUTTON_REPLY_ALL |
			       MODEST_TOOLBAR_BUTTON_FORWARD);
  etc., and a emits a signal with a parameter for the button
  that was clicked.

- implement ModestAccountSetup, which gives an easy interface to ModestAccountMgr,
  and makes sure the values are sane (one Transport, one Store per account,
  and esp. should make it easy to make a 'wizard' on the UI side, so have
  something like _commit.  

- in terms of these, the UI implementations. There should be little logic in the
UI implementations.


maemo specific
--------------
- make ModestAddressBook in terms of the Maemo addressbook
  The EBook etc. stuff shouldn't leak through the abstraction,
  as there could be non-EDS based addresbooks as well
- make ModestTnyConnectionMgr, using the Maemo Connectivity library,
  in case of non-Maemo, we can use the existing implementation
  in tinymail

misc items
----------
- set up compilation in scratchbox
- set up packaging of tinymail, camel and friends
- make 770-packages
- set up i18n stuff (po/ etc.)
- get gtk-doc working with all the stuff
- get some more stuff working through the cmdline for testing,
  such as modest --list-accounts
