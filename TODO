i001: add a message view window; it's quite different from the edit view,
      as it is readonly, and will use the html-view instead of text-view
i002: message view and message edit window should know what account they apply to;
      thus, the 'From:' information and TransportAccount can be decided
i003: when creating a new message, the information should be set according to i002
i004: message windows should get all the icons/toolbars/menus
i005: all available menu items / toolbar items  should have accompanying
      actions, or be removed

      delete, move, etc.)
i007: make connecting to server async and  cancellable, progress shown
i008: make sending message async and cancellable, progress shown
i009: implement the send queue stuff; different queues for different
      transports, but one outbox shown in ui. (use symlinks?)
i010: make the modest manpage
i011: make the modest webpage
i012: use the platform icons (don't ship icons unless not provided by platform)
