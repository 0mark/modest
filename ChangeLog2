	* src/modest-local-folder-info.c:
	(modest_local_folder_info_get_type_display_name): Use _() to actually get the translated string. 
	N_() was already used on the static strings, but this just marks it for translation without 
	using the translation.

2007-04-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* src/maemo/modest-account-settings-dialog.c:
	(create_page_incoming),
	(modest_account_settings_dialog_set_account_name): 
	Added comments about the need for new API in ModestAccountMgr to handle the authentication 
	and secure-connection stuff that is stored in the options GSList* with hard-coded names.
	I will do this if nobody else gets there first.

2007-04-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* src/maemo/modest-account-settings-dialog.c: (save_configuration): 
	Saved much of the incoming and outgoing data too, though I cannot yet see how to 
	save the security stuff.

2007-04-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* src/maemo/easysetup/modest-easysetup-wizard.c: (create_account): 
	Set the email address and user fullname, which I now see must be 
	done separately.
	
	* src/maemo/modest-account-settings-dialog.h:
	* src/maemo/modest-account-settings-dialog.c:
	 (on_response),
	(modest_account_settings_dialog_set_account_name): Show the email address, fullname, 
	leave-on-server and authentication.
	(save_configuration): Save most of the non-server-account specific stuff, but I don't see 
	how to do the rest.

2007-04-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>


	* src/maemo/modest-account-settings-dialog.c:
	* src/maemo/modest-account-settings-dialog.h:
	Most (but not all) of the widgets are now present as specified by the UI spec.
	No changes are yet saved, and some details are not properly shown yet.
	
	* po/en_GB.po: Added translations for logical IDs used by the Account Settings dialog.

2007-04-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* src/maemo/Makefile.am:
	* src/maemo/modest-account-settings-dialog.c:
	* src/maemo/modest-account-settings-dialog.h: The beginnings of the dialog to edit 
	an existing account. Doesn't do much yet.
	
	* src/maemo/modest-account-view-window.c: (on_edit_button_clicked): 
	Open the accounts settings dialog when Edit is clicked.

2007-04-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* src/maemo/easysetup/Makefile.am:
	* src/maemo/easysetup/modest-easysetup-country-combo-box.c:
	(load_from_file): 
	* src/maemo/easysetup/modest-easysetup-wizard.c:
	(modest_easysetup_wizard_dialog_init):
	Try to get the source directory from the build system,
	instead of hard-coding "./" into the source code, when opening our local 
	copies of the configuration files.
	But this still fails when opening the wizard from the Accounts window, 
	maybe because the working directory seems to change at runtime.
	So the wizard will fail the second time unless you copy the files into their 
	proper locations - see the stdout warnings for the paths.
	
	(create_page_account_details),(on_before_next): 
	Check for existing non-server accounts instead of server accounts, 
	so the default account name is useful again, and to prevent trying to 
	recreate accounts.
	
	* src/maemo/modest-account-view-window.c: (on_new_button_clicked): 
	Show the wizard when New is clicked.
	
	* src/widgets/modest-account-view.c: (on_account_default_toggled),
	(init_view): Show the column headers, and show the columns that are 
	specified in the UI specs. However, something in Maemo's GTK+ prevents 
	us from handling the GtkCellRendererToggle::toggled signal, so we cannot 
	change the default account. This is despite unsetting the special properties.

2007-04-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/reference/modest-design.sgml: Corrected spelling mistake.
	* src/maemo/easysetup/modest-easysetup-wizard.c: (create_account): 
	Create the 2 server accounts and then create the account, using the names of the 2 server accounts.
	This seems to be how this should be used. If it is, then I will update the AccountMgr documentation 
	to make that clearer.
	* src/modest-account-mgr.h: Corrected the modest_account_mgr_search_server_account() documentation.

2007-04-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* src/maemo/modest-account-view-window.c:
	(modest_account_view_window_init),
	(modest_account_view_window_new):
	Use the same buttons as specified in the 
	UI spec. Add the widgets to the vbox and action_area instead of just assigning them to 
	the existing widgets, which never had a chance of working.
	Put the ModestAccountView treeview in a scrolled window.
	Do not repeat the initialization in both _init() and _new().
	
	* src/widgets/modest-account-view.c: (update_account_view):
	Add a warning about modest_account_mgr_account_names() returning NULL, which is why 
	this widget and window shows no accounts.
	
	* po/en_GB.po: Added translations needed for the dialog button logical IDs.
	
2007-04-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* src/maemo/easysetup/modest-easysetup-wizard.c:
	(set_default_custom_servernames): Avoid a dereference of a destroyed widget.
	(create_account): Do a sanity check, showing that modest_account_mgr_account_names() 
	returns NULL after modest_account_mgr_add_server_account() returned TRUE, 
	which seems wrong.
	
	* src/maemo/modest-main-window-ui.h: Specify the callback for the Accounts menu item.
	* src/modest-ui-actions.c: (modest_ui_actions_on_accounts): Open the wizard if no 
	accounts exist yet, as in the UI spec.
	
	* src/modest-account-mgr.h: Add TODO comment about a possible memory leak.

	* src/maemo/Makefile.am:
	* src/maemo/modest-connection-specific-smtp-edit-window.c:
	* src/maemo/modest-connection-specific-smtp-edit-window.h: 
	New window for editing connection-specific smtp details.
	Not fully implemented.

	* src/maemo/modest-connection-specific-smtp-window.c:
	(modest_connection_specific_smtp_window_finalize) :
	unref the tree model.
	(on_button_edit): Show the edit window.

2007-04-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: Change sequence of sub-libraries, which fixed an undefined symbol 
	error for me.
	
	* src/maemo/Makefile.am:
	* src/maemo/modest-connection-specific-smtp-window.c:
	* src/maemo/modest-connection-specific-smtp-window.h:
	New window for showing the list of connections, for connection-specific 
	SMTP servers. Not fully implemented, because it needs an enhancement to TnyMaemoDevice.
	* src/maemo/easysetup/modest-easysetup-wizard.c:
	(create_page_custom_outgoing): Show the new window when the button is clicked.

2007-04-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	(modest_mail_operation_send_new_mail):
	* src/modest-ui-actions.c: (modest_ui_actions_on_accounts),
	(modest_ui_actions_on_new_account):
	* src/widgets/modest-attachment-view.c: (update_filename_request):
	* src/widgets/modest-mail-header-view.c: 
	Corrected warnings that were breaking the build, by commenting out unused variables, 
	and a function, and by including a header.

2007-04-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* configure.ac: Define MODEST_PLATFORM_MAEMO and MODEST_PLATFORM_GNOME in config.h, 
	so we can #ifdef around platform-specific code when necessary.
	* src/modest-ui-actions.c: (modest_ui_actions_on_new_account): Use MODEST_PLATFORM_MAEMO 
	to allow this to build for the GNOME platform too.

2007-04-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* src/maemo/easysetup/modest-easysetup-wizard.c:
	Added util_increment_name() and used it in create_page_account_details() 
	to make sure that the default account name is always a new name.
	
	(modest_easysetup_wizard_dialog_init), 
	(set_default_custom_servernames): Some minor memory management fixes.

2007-04-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Makefile.am:
	* configure.ac:
	* src/modest-runtime.c: (init_i18n): Restored the translation 
	infrastructure, so that GETTEXT_PACKAGE and MODEST_LOCALE_DIR 
	are defined in config.h, and the translations are installed.
	
	* src/maemo/easysetup/: Include config.h so that GETTEXT_PACKAGE 
	is defined for translation.

2007-04-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* src/maemo/easysetup/modest-easysetup-country-combo-box.c:
	(load_from_file):
	* src/maemo/easysetup/modest-easysetup-wizard.c:
	(modest_easysetup_wizard_dialog_init):
	* src/maemo/easysetup/modest-presets.c: (modest_presets_new): 
	Use realistic paths (though they should use $prefix generically) to the 
	mcc_mapping and provider-data.keyfile files which might work when they 
	are installed by the future version of the operator-wizard package, 
	and then fallback to paths in our source code, with an explanatory 
	warning.

2007-04-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* configure.ac:
	* src/Makefile.am:
	* src/maemo/Makefile.am:
	* src/maemo/easysetup/: Added files from the previously-exernal 
	osso-modest-easysetup.
	* src/maemo/modest-main-window-ui.h:
	* src/modest-ui-actions.c: 
	* src/modest-ui-actions.h:
	Added modest_ui_actions_on_new_account() as a signal handler for the 
	New Account menu item. It shows the easysetup wizard.
	* po/en_GB.po: Added additional needed logical IDs and translations.
	
Started ChangeLog2 file, because I cannot work without a ChangeLog. murrayc.
Apparently ChangeLog is not used for some vague Nokia legal reasons.
