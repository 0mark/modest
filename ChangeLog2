	* src/maemo/easysetup/modest-easysetup-country-combo-box.c:
	(load_from_file):

	(modest_easysetup_wizard_dialog_init):
	* src/maemo/easysetup/modest-presets.c: (modest_presets_new): 
	Use realistic paths (though they should use $prefix generically) to the 
	mcc_mapping and provider-data.keyfile files which might work when they 
	are installed by the future version of the operator-wizard package, 
	and then fallback to paths in our source code, with an explanatory 
	warning.
