	* src/maemo/easysetup/modest-easysetup-wizard.c:
	Added util_increment_name() and used it in create_page_account_details() 
	to make sure that the default account name is always a new name.
	
	(modest_easysetup_wizard_dialog_init), 
	(set_default_custom_servernames): Some minor memory management fixes.

	* Makefile.am:
	* configure.ac:
	* src/modest-runtime.c: (init_i18n): Restored the translation 
	infrastructure, so that GETTEXT_PACKAGE and MODEST_LOCALE_DIR 
	are defined in config.h, and the translations are installed.
	
	* src/maemo/easysetup/: Include config.h so that GETTEXT_PACKAGE 
	is defined for translation.

	(modest_easysetup_wizard_dialog_init):
	* src/maemo/easysetup/modest-presets.c: (modest_presets_new): 
	Use realistic paths (though they should use $prefix generically) to the 
	mcc_mapping and provider-data.keyfile files which might work when they 
	are installed by the future version of the operator-wizard package, 
	and then fallback to paths in our source code, with an explanatory 
	warning.

Started ChangeLog2 file, because I cannot work without a ChangeLog. murrayc.
Apparently ChangeLog is not used for some vague Nokia legal reasons.
